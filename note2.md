how hard would it to be to add a failsafe of if the game is not in my list in the cache (which remember is based on my massive game library), we would be able to search the steam api and get it anyway, adding it to the cache?

🔍 Adding a Failsafe for Missing Games in Cache
It’s very doable to add a system where:

If a game isn’t in your cache, we query the Steam API directly.
We add the missing game to the cache so it's available next time.
🛠 How Would This Work?
Right now, !info only looks at your cached game list.
Instead of just saying "Game not found", we can check Steam's API for missing games.
🔹 Step 1: Modify info to Search Steam API When Needed
Find this section in commands.py:

python
Copy
Edit
matches = utils.find_similar_game(game_name, list(games.keys()))

if not matches:
    await ctx.send(f"❌ Couldn't find any games matching '{game_name}'")
    return
Replace it with:

python
Copy
Edit
matches = utils.find_similar_game(game_name, list(games.keys()))

if not matches:
    await ctx.send(f"🔍 '{game_name}' isn't in your library. Checking Steam API...")

    steam_data = self.steam.fetch_game_from_api(game_name)  # New function

    if not steam_data:
        await ctx.send(f"❌ Couldn't find '{game_name}' on Steam either.")
        return

    # Add to cache
    self.steam.add_game_to_cache(game_name, steam_data)

    await ctx.send(f"✅ Found '{game_name}' on Steam! Added to your game list.")
    matches = [game_name]  # Now treat it as a found game
✅ Now, if a game isn’t in your library, the bot automatically searches Steam.

🔹 Step 2: Create fetch_game_from_api() in steam.py
We need a function that calls the Steam Store API to find missing games.

Add this inside steam.py:

python
Copy
Edit
import requests

def fetch_game_from_api(self, game_name: str) -> Optional[Dict]:
    """Search Steam API for a game by name and return its details if found."""

    url = "https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamApps/GetAppList/v2/"
    
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        if response.status_code != 200:
            logger.error(f"Steam API error: {response.text}")
            return None
        
        data = response.json().get("applist", {}).get("apps", [])
        
        # Find the closest matching game
        for game in data:
            if game_name.lower() in game["name"].lower():
                return {
                    "appid": game["appid"],
                    "name": game["name"],
                    "genres": [],
                    "description": "No description available",
                }

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error searching for game '{game_name}': {e}")
    
    return None
✅ Now we can search Steam for any game and retrieve its basic details.

🔹 Step 3: Save the Missing Game to the Cache
Now, let’s add the missing game to our cache so it’s permanently stored.

Add this to steam.py:

python
Copy
Edit
def add_game_to_cache(self, game_name: str, game_data: Dict):
    """Add a new game to the cache and save the file."""

    cache = self.load_cache()
    cache["games"][game_name] = {
        "appid": game_data["appid"],
        "genres": game_data.get("genres", []),
        "description": game_data.get("description", "No description available"),
        "last_updated": time.time()
    }

    self.save_cache(cache)
    logger.info(f"Added '{game_name}' to cache.")
✅ Now every time we find a missing game, it’s stored permanently.

📌 Final Result
If a game isn't in your cache, the bot searches Steam’s API.
If found, it adds the game to your cache so it’s stored for future use.
Next time, it’s available instantly without needing to search Steam again.
